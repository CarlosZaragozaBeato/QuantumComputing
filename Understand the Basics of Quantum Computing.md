Quantum Computing and classical computing area fundamentally different paradigms that operate on distinct principles. Here's a breakdown of their key differences: 


### Difference between classical and quantum computing.

### Classical Computing 
* [Relies on bits](https://physics.berkeley.edu/news-events/news/from-bits-to-qubits#:~:text=In%20a%20classical%20computer%2C%20a,off%20switches%20in%20the%20hardware.): Classical computer use bits to store and process information. A bit can represent either 0 or 1
* [Sequential processing](https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing#:~:text=Unlike%20classical%20computers%20that%20must,qubits%20can%20process%20enormous%20datasets): Classical computers perform calculations sequentially, one step at a time.
* Limiter by physical constraints: The speed of classical computers is limited by the physical constraints of transistors and the speed of the clock
