Quantum Computing and classical computing area fundamentally different paradigms that operate on distinct principles. Here's a breakdown of their key differences: 


### Difference between classical and quantum computing.

### Classical Computing 
* [Relies on bits](https://physics.berkeley.edu/news-events/news/from-bits-to-qubits#:~:text=In%20a%20classical%20computer%2C%20a,off%20switches%20in%20the%20hardware.): Classical computer use bits to store and process information. A bit can represent either 0 or 1
* [Sequential processing](https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing#:~:text=Unlike%20classical%20computers%20that%20must,qubits%20can%20process%20enormous%20datasets): Classical computers perform calculations sequentially, one step at a time.
* Limiter by physical constraints: The speed of classical computers is limited by the physical constraints of transistors and the speed of the clock
* Foundation: Based on classical physics, specifically boolean logic
* Strengths: Excellent for everyday tasks like browsing the internet, running office software, and playing games
* Limitations: Struggles with complex problems involving large datasets, such as:
	* [Factoring large numbers](https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/strategie/vision-teams/quantum-computing/applications/factorization-and-encryption): Crucial for cryptography
	* [Drug discovery](https://otd.harvard.edu/news/quantum-computer-simulates-molecules-behavior-accurately/#:~:text=Classical%20computers%20can%20model%20simple,take%20place%20in%20more%20complex): Simulating molecular iterations. 
	* [Materials science](https://ece.princeton.edu/news/materials-advances-are-key-development-quantum-hardware#:~:text=%E2%80%9CJust%20as%20classical%20computing%20hardware,think%20the%20quantum%20technologies%20field): Designing new materials.

### Quantum Computing
* [Foundation](https://www.iberdrola.com/innovation/what-is-quantum-computing#:~:text=This%20branch%20of%20computer%20science,a%20different%20computation%20method%20from): Based on quantum mechanics, utilizing phenomena like superposition and entanglement.
* [Qubits](https://www.iberdrola.com/innovation/what-is-quantum-computing#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20qubit%3F,rather%20than%20the%20conventional%20bit.): Employs qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously (both 0 and 1 and the same time)
* [Processing](https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing#:~:text=This%20superposition%20of%20qubits%20gives,to%20process%20many%20inputs%20simultaneously.): Can perform many calculations concurrently due to superposition, leading to potential for significant speedups for certain problems.
* [Strength](https://altair.com/blog/when-classical-and-quantum-computing-collide#:~:text=Quantum%20computers%20are%20expected%20to%20unlock%20new%20use%20cases%20and,are%20intractable%20on%20classical%20supercomputers.): Shows promise in solving problems that intractable for classical computers, such as those listed above.
* Limitations:
	* Currently in early stages of development: Hardware is complex and expensive, and error rates are still high.
	* Requires specialized algorithms: Not all problems can be efficiently solved on a quantum computer.
	* Delicate: Qubits are fragile and easily disrupted by their environment

#### In essence:
* Classical computers are like traditional calculators, performing calculations step-by-step.
* Quantum computers are like having many calculators working simultaneously, potentially solving certain problems much faster.

#### Key concepts
* Superposition: Qubits can exist in a combination of 0 and 1 states simultaneously.
* Entanglement: Qubits can be linked, suck that the state of one qubit instantly influences the state of another, regardless of distance.
#### It's important to note:
* Quantum computers are not meant to replace classical computers. They are designed to excel at specific types of problems.
* They field of quantum computing is still under active research and development.
